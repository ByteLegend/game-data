      Kotlin Island is a real island on the earth, located in [60°00′45″N 29°44′01″E](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kotlin+Island/@60.001918,29.6841031,13z).
      We intentionally make this island have the similar shape as the real Kotlin Island, but unfortunately it's not finished yet 😞. Coming soon.

      我们故意让这个岛和真实的Kotlin岛形状相似，但是不幸的是它还没完成😞。敬请期待！
